## About this Wiki

Ludic Lexicon systematically documents and analyzes game design principles across diverse titles. This knowledge base examines gameplay mechanics, level architecture, narrative structures, and technical implementation, highlighting both successful and suboptimal design choices.

At its core, this project views games as sophisticated teaching tools — each one offering lessons about engagement, storytelling, and interactive design that we can extract, understand, and apply.

!!! info "Work in Progress"
    This wiki is actively being developed. New analyses and insights will be added regularly as games are studied and documented.
    
    **Currently working on:** A full analysis of [Lies of P](https://www.igdb.com/games/lies-of-p), exploring its soulslike mechanics, level design, and narrative structure.

## Navigation Guide

### [:material-magnify-expand: Game Analysis](./games/)
Detailed explorations of specific games, examining their design choices level by level, system by system.

### [:material-library: Design Concepts](./concepts/)
Core game design theories, principles, and methodologies that form the foundation of effective game design.

### [:material-school: Resources](./resources/)
Tools, terminology, and references for game designers of all experience levels.

## Methodology

Ludic Lexicon approaches game analysis through multiple lenses:

- **Level Walkthroughs**: Spatial analysis with flow mapping and improvement proposals
- **System Breakdowns**: Examining how mechanics interact to create emergent gameplay
- **Cultural Context**: Exploring historical and artistic influences on game design
- **Player Psychology**: Understanding how design shapes player engagement and emotion

Each analysis seeks to uncover what games teach us, consciously or unconsciously, about design, player behavior, and effective engagement. By dissecting and understanding these inherent lessons, we learn not just about games, but through them.

## About the Author

![Maximilian Koch](assets/profile.webp){ align=right width="400" }

**[Maximilian Koch](https://maximiliankoch.at/about){:target="_blank"}** is a game designer and developer with a passion for analyzing and deconstructing game design elements. With experience in both theoretical game design and practical development, he created Ludic Lexicon as a platform to share insights and document the ongoing journey of learning game design through analytical play.

The project reflects a belief that every game, whether intentionally or not, functions as a teacher, and through careful study, we can extract valuable lessons about what engages, challenges, and delights players.
