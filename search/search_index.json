With experience in both theoretical game design and practical development, he created Ludic Lexicon as a platform to share insights and document the ongoing journey of learning game design through analytical play.</p> <p>The project reflects a belief that every game, whether intentionally or not, functions as a teacher, and through careful study, we can extract valuable lessons about what engages, challenges, and delights players.</p>"},{"location":"#connect-contribute","title":"Connect &amp; Contribute","text":"<p>Have thoughts on game design or suggestions for this wiki?
